  <div class="question">
    <p>
      A train leaves Paris for Lyon, Saturday September 12th 1985, day of a lunar eclipse.<br>
      It will ride at 216 km/h, the wind blows S/SE at a factor 5, and the temperature outside
      the train is 13°C, and 22°C inside. The sky is cloudy. Another train leaves
      Lyon for Paris, on the same day at 23:00. It is riding at 224km/h.<br>
      <b>Which one of these two trains will be the furthest away from Paris when they will cross path?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      While you mull over the question, have a SNCF ham and cheese sandwich commonly
      referred as “Drop-down menu”.
